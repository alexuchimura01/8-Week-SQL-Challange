### Business Problem

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

``` SQL
CREATE SCHEMA dannys_diner;

CREATE TABLE sales (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),

INSERT INTO sales
  ("customer_id", "order_date", "product_id")

CREATE TABLE members (

INSERT INTO members
  ("customer_id", "join_date")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');
```

The above database was pre-created on DB Fiddle, and the following solutions will be code and solutions that were run on DB Fiddle.

### Case Study Questions & Answers
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

``` sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(price) as total_spent
FROM sales s JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```
| Customer | Total Spent           |
|------------|----------------|
| A          | 76   |
| B          | 74    |
| C          | 36       |

- Step 1: Join sales and menu tables since we are wanting to find price per customer.
  
- Step 2: Group by customer_id.
  
- Step 3: Select customer_id, the sum of price, and create an alias for SUM(price).
***
**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

``` sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) as days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

| Customer | Days Visited           |
|------------|----------------|
| A          | 4   |
| B          | 6    |
| C          | 2       |

- Step 1: Select customer_id and and the count of distinct order_date since one order date signifies the date a customer visited the restaurant.
- Step 2: Group by customer_id.
***
**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```sql
WITH ordered_purchase AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id, 
    s.product_id,
    s.order_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.order_date ASC) AS rn
  FROM sales s
)

SELECT 
  op.customer_id,
  m.product_name,
  op.order_date
FROM ordered_purchase op
JOIN menu m ON op.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE op.rn = 1;

```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac61fd7-790f-4511-872e-993981f338e5)

- Step 1: Create a mini table called 'ordered_purchase' containing assigned row numbers for each purchase made by customer, ordered by order_date in ascending order. Here the ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY...) clause is partitioning row number assignments to each customer_id, so each customer gets their own independent ranking sequence by order_date, assigning row number 1 to the first purchase.
- Step 2: Join the 'ordered_purchase' table with menu with the condition of showing only the first row for each customer_id. This is the earliest order_date by customer due to row number partitioning.
- Step 3: Select customer_id, product_name, and order_date.
***
**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
``` sql
SELECT m.product_name AS most_purchased, COUNT(m.product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM sales s JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY m.product_name
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
| Most Purchased | Purchase Count   |
|------------|----------------|
| Ramen          | 8   |

- Step 1: Join sales and menu tables to get the count of products sold and product name in the same query.
- Step 2: Select the count of products from the sales table, group by product name, order the count in descending order and choose the first row.
***
**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
```sql
WITH most_popular AS (
  SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(m.product_id) AS times_ordered, m.product_name as most_popular,
  	DENSE_RANK() OVER (
    	PARTITION BY s.customer_id
    	ORDER BY COUNT(m.product_id) DESC) AS RANK
  FROM menu m 
  JOIN sales s
  ON m.product_id = s.product_id
  GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name)
  
 SELECT customer_id, times_ordered, most_popular
  FROM most_popular
  WHERE rank = 1;
```
***
**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

***
**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

***
**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

***
**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**

***
**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
