### Business Problem

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

``` SQL
CREATE SCHEMA dannys_diner;
SET search_path = dannys_diner;

CREATE TABLE sales (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "order_date" DATE,
  "product_id" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO sales
  ("customer_id", "order_date", "product_id")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),

CREATE TABLE menu (

INSERT INTO menu
  ("product_id", "product_name", "price")
VALUES
  ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');
  

CREATE TABLE members (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "join_date" DATE
);

INSERT INTO members
  ("customer_id", "join_date")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');
```

The above database was pre-created on DB Fiddle, and the following solutions will be code and solutions that were run on DB Fiddle.

### Case Study Questions & Answers
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

``` sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(price) as total_spent
FROM sales s JOIN menu m
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```
| Customer | Total Spent           |
|------------|----------------|
| A          | 76   |
| B          | 74    |
| C          | 36       |

- Step 1: Join sales and menu tables since we are wanting to find price per customer.
  
- Step 2: Group by customer_id.
  
- Step 3: Select customer_id, the sum of price, and create an alias for SUM(price).
  


**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

``` sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) as days_visited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**


**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**


**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**


**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**


**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**


**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**


**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**


**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
