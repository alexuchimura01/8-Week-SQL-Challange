# 8-Week-SQL-Challange
This repository showcases my SQL knowledge and proficiency through 8 case studies from the #8WeekSQLChallenge. The *8-Week-SQL-Challenge*, created by [@datawithdanny](https://github.com/datawithdanny), features eight case studies designed to test and enhance SQL proficiency. Successfully completing them demonstrates strong, foundational SQL knowledge. All data comes from a PostgreSQL database created on DB Fiddle (in most cases) and information on each case study may be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)!
